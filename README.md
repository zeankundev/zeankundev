# yo hey there, random stranger :)
i'm zeankun.dev. i make shit like [CompassCAD](https://github.com/zeankundev/CompassCAD) and [Suside](https://github.com/zeankundev/suside) (you've probably known Suside from Bringus Studios so yeah, i'm that one guy :)
## uh tell us more about you
- i am zeankun.dev, you can call me zean or zeankun, whatever that works.
- i study ofc :) *(psst, mathematics and compsci are my favs)*
- besides than writing code here, i also publish my open source PCBs that i've made so far, so YOU (yes, you), can sell boards that i design (under your own brand pls) and make cash.
- i'm more dominant in electrical engineering rather than compsi, so you're safe to say that coding is just my hobby.
- if you're here as a result of stalking my accounts *(because i did cosplays on tiktok and insta)*, well congrats, i'm real, and i made those content :)

<hr/>

i'll add more shit here later on. cya ;)
