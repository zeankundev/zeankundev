# yo hey there, random stranger :)
i'm zeankun (formerly known as zeankun.dev). i make shit like [CompassCAD](https://github.com/zeankundev/CompassCAD) and [Suside](https://github.com/zeankundev/suside) (you've probably known Suside from Bringus Studios so yeah, i'm that one guy :)

i'm actually [Leoneuryguy's](https://tiktok.com/@Leoneuryguy) **biological big brother**. that's why you see both me and Leon at the same time

i also experiment a lot with offline AI (in case, well, if something catastrophic happens) with the Pi 5

besides that, i love listening to vocaloid as part of my work or coding sessions or anything professional. my favs are **Kasane Teto** and **Hatsune Miku**. fav Vocaloid artist? **[Jamie Paige ofc!](https://jamies.page)** (*current favorites are* **Machine Love** *and* **BIRDBRAIN**)

## uh tell us more about you
- i am zeankun.dev, you can call me zean or zeankun, whatever that works.
- bday's at 1st January (nocap like fr)
- i study ofc :) *(psst, mathematics and compsci are my favs)*
- besides than writing code here, i also publish my open source PCBs that i've made so far, so YOU (yes, you), can sell boards that i design (under your own brand pls) and make cash.
- i'm more dominant in electrical engineering rather than compsi, so you're safe to say that coding is just my hobby.
- if you're here as a result of stalking my accounts *(because i did cosplays on tiktok and insta)*, well congrats, i'm real, and i made those content :)
- as of writing, I'm now a maimai player!
